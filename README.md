# datafun_03_analytics

In Module 3, we introduce virtual environments - a way to install additional code without impacting our machine's global Python installation. 

This project focuses on reading, processing, and writing different types of data files. We'll explore Python lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples. We'll read and write data files including text, csv, JSON, and Excel - and we'll learn a bit of Markdown to format our README.md. We'll use the terminal to fetch content from the web. It's powerful - and easy! 

We learn more about Git - a software system to sync project code between GitHub and our machine. Git keeps a detailed history of our changes - which we label using "commit messages". We can track our progress - and get back to a working version as needed.
